# TODO

## Brains

* Should start testing the initial state straight away
* Threading should be respected
* Should run the ovenUpdate functions in a background thread with things half paused
* Should support pause/unpause

## Web UI

* Web testing pass count is off by one (total doesn't take into account Nothing)
* Should display the state with zero patches
* Add this server to the list of clients
* Use Id values to display stdout with a header

## Git

* Better diff stat output, with hyperlinks and colors
* Better summary output - which file trees and the commit message (two lines)
